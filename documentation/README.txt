Introduction of NMP
Monitoring computers on a network is a vital part of today’s society. Computers are absolutely great when they are functioning as intended. However, computers may be absolutely horrid when they are not functioning as intended, Computers don’t necessarily tell you anything unless you dig for what you want to find or are at the scene when the computer malfunctions. If a computer’s temperature is rising and or is reaching heights unsafe for a computer, it may become damaged beyond repair without anyone realizing. If a computer is running at one hundred percent CPU utilization, we would want to know why otherwise it may be causing unnecessary heat, spend more power than necessary, or even potentially be doing something that it shouldn’t be doing. NMP’s purpose is to monitor computers and their statuses such as temperature, CPU utilization, and potentially more so that when things do go wrong, they do tell you.

How NMP Addresses Problems
A description of how your project addresses that problem.   

Components and Architecture
Provide the architecture of your project: what are the components including UNIX services and custom software you wrote, how do they interact with each other, using what protocols?  

Features
Provide a description of the features of your project: what does it do and what can it be used for?  

Interaction
If the project involves user input, describe how the users would interact with it in order to use the features.  

Analysis
If the project involved testing and analyzing results, provide those results in a clearly understandable format
